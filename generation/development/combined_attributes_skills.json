Typically, a Stealth + Agility test is made at the start of such an effort, with the net hits being used as a threshold for others to notice what the character is up to. Sometimes the attempt at stealth happens spontaneously, so it is a Stealth + Agility vs. Perception + Intuition Opposed test. In some circumstances, but not all, the size of a character may play a role in how stealthy they can be. If the gamemaster judges it to be appropriate, the Body of a character can be used as a threshold for their Stealth + Agility test, or the threshold can be increased based in their size."

Perception is also used to attempt to see those who do not wish to be seen, in which case the test is Perception + Intuition vs. Stealth + Agility (sometimes these tests are not rolled concurrently; see the Stealth section for more details). Sometimes Perception is about more than just taking in the details of your surroundings or trying to spot a hidden object. It may be about seeing how different things link to each other, or discerning a pattern in events or movements. In those cases, a gamemaster can have a player make a Perception + Logic test, with the threshold based on the complexity of the information they are trying to piece together."

Whatever the case may be, Con is the skill you use to convince other people that you are something you are not. Tests involving Con are Opposed tests, and the target rolls Intuition + Willpower to resist the con. Usually this is a simple pass/fail test, looking at whether the character pulled off their con or not, but if they scored a high number of net hits, the gamemaster can consider the con to be extra persuasive, making the mark an all-the-more-willing participant."

It might be said that this is the more honest side, but that would be underselling the integrity of con artists and overselling the honesty of business negotiators. The point is, whether you are trying to inspire your fellow runners, squeeze a few nuyen out of Mr. Johnson, or let someone know that intense physical pain awaits them if they cross you, Influence is the skill to use. The test usually is Influence + Charisma, but sometimes it can be Influence + Logic when the character is relying on pure reason to get their point across. It is opposed by Willpower + Intuition when Charisma is used, Willpower + Logic when Logic is used. Influence is also used for Instruction tests, which can shorten the time it takes to learn new skills (see p. 68). Instructors must have 4 or more ranks in the skill they want to teach. The instructor makes an Influence + Charisma test, which reduces the time to learn a skill by 1 day per net hit.
